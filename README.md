# Igpay Atinlay (Pig Latin) Translator 

You should be working through this exercise with a partner! One of you should be the "driver" and one of you should be the "navigator". The "driver" will be the person typing, and the navigator will be the person directing what code should be written. 

## Make sure to switch who is the driver and who is the navigator every 10-15 minutes!
  - Before you get started play around with this [translator](https://lingojam.com/PigLatinTranslator) to familiarize yourself with pig latin.
  - Create a function called `englishToPigLatin` that takes an English `word`. Your function should translate the given English word into Pig Latin. See example below...
      ```
        englishToPigLatin("distance");
          => "istanceday"
        
        englishToPigLatin("friendly");
          => "iendlyfray"
        
        englishToPigLatin("explain");
          => "explainyay"
        
        englishToPigLatin("string");
          => "ingstray"
      ```

## Extension (can be done solo if you'd like)
  - Does your function work for sentences too?
    ```
    
    englishToPigLatin("The store was jammed before the sale could start. The crooked maze failed to fool the mouse.");
      
      => "ethay orestay asway ammedjay eforebay ethay alesay ouldcay artstay. Ethay ookedcray azemay ailedfay otay oolfay ethay ousemay."
